# Elementary Symbol Table

A symbol table is a data type that we use to associate *keys* and *values*. Clients can store these key-value pairs within the symbol table and then retrieve the value corresponding to a requested key. The API for an elementary symbol table includes get and put methods to store the key-value pairs and retrive the values according to the key. There are also methods for checking if a key is contained in the symbol table. 

Additional methods may include being able to compare keys. If this behavior is not required, a Hash Table implementation of a symbol table is often efficient for large number of keys. If having comparable keys is required behavior, a common implementation is the Binary Search Tree.

My API
----------

The code here is non-functional because it depends on a Record data type provided in the class. It can be thought of as something like this

```
struct
{
    const KeyType    key;
          DataType value;
    // (String keys, String data)
    // Comparable methods, get/put methods for Key() and Data()
    // etc.
};
```

It has been too long since I worked on this code for class that I don't fully recall what was needed in its API, but I know things are missing. I have considered adopting the `std::pair <utility>` data type, but at this point, that will be a waste of time for something *I* already understand, and rather put effort into building in Java or C# (Sorry C++, I don't have fun with you!). Additionally, I never solved the delete requirement for the BSTree. It's not too difficult, but I never had time. Again, at this point is just isn't worth the effort. Try deleting in a Red-Black Tree instead! 

This API is left here as a demonstration of the pedogogical work performed in my CISP 400 Data Structures class from American River College, taught by the great David Fox. I would definitely say the main.cpp files need cleaning, use a different data set (simpler data set, like names and ages), and redesign the APIs to use core C++ data types like string and pairs, appropriately. 

Report and Stuff and Junk
------------

When my code did work, I ran some tests and compiled a report of the performance between the two implementations. Including in the code files is a list of hash functions that could be utilized in the Hash Table. This is an area I would definitely want to learn more about, because it is far from intuitive. Maybe a class on cryptography would be in order??
